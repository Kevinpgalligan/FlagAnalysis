### Notes on most common colours
Since there is a huge variety in the colours in the national flags, it makes sense to "round" each pixel to the "nearest" of a selection of common colours (measured by Euclidean distance). Otherwise, there wouldn't be a meaningful count. The common colours used were: white, silver, gray, black, red, maroon, yellow, olive, lime, green, aqua, teal, blue, navy, fuchsia and purple. We see that red is the most common colour in national flags. The colour of passion, anger, and... blood.
