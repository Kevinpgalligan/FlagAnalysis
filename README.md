# FlagAnalysis
Colour analysis of national flags.

There are two interesting images in the `results/` folder:
1. An "average" flag made by merging all national flags (i.e. at co-ordinate (0, 0) in the average flag, the value of the pixel is the average value of all pixels at (0, 0) in the national flags).
2. A bar chart showing the percentage use of each colour on national flags. Red and blue appear to have the strongest showing.
